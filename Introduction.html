							<h2>Background Information</h2>
							<p>I am a soon-to-be freshly minted graduate with a B.Sc. in Business Administration and a concentration in Management Information Systems at East Carolina University. In combining a rigorous academic experience with professional roles in the public and private sector, I have exemplified my keen ability to research and analyze data, collaborate on teams, and drive business development. Recognized for improving operational optimization, I have a verifiable history of professional success as both a student and a worker. Professional focal points include data analysis, social media marketing, e-commerce, business development, strategy development, web development, management information systems, technology solutions, project management, operations optimization, and cross-functional team collaboration.<br>
							  <br>
							  Currently, I am a Freelance Visual Artist with 919Native. Within this role, I deliver a wide range of logos and graphic designs, as well as animations and CGI to clients. Previously, I founded and operated my own business, using various social media platforms to reach audiences through innovative marketing strategies and promotions. In these experiences, I have honed my abilities to interact and communicate meaningfully with clients, provide deliverables within designated deadlines, and collect and analyze necessary data.<br>
							  <br>
							  Colleagues and professors describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, enthusiastic team player with a strong work ethic and diligent problem-solving skills.<br>
							  <br>
							  I am interested in contacting former colleagues and managers, as well as other professionals in my field. Feel free to contact me through this profile if you wish to connect.<br>
							  <br>
						    I am pursuing new opportunities and can be reached through this profile, or by phone at: 919-561-0351</p>
